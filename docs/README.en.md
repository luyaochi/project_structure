# 🚀 Project Structure Generator

**Let AI design the architecture. Let this tool make it real.**

Have you ever asked an AI to design a perfect project architecture—
only to spend the next 30 minutes manually creating folders and boilerplate files?

**Project Structure Generator** is a tool built for **Documentation-Driven Development (DDD)**.
It turns tree-style structures written in `README.md` into real, executable project skeletons—instantly.

---

## ✨ Key Highlights

- **📖 Documentation as Architecture**
  Directly parses Markdown tree symbols such as `├─` and `└─`.

- **🤖 AI-Friendly Workflow**
  Seamlessly integrates with architectures generated by ChatGPT or Claude.

- **📄 Smart Templates**
  Automatically detects file extensions and generates meaningful boilerplate for
  `.py`, `.md`, `pyproject.toml`, and `package.json`.

- **🛡️ Quality Assurance Built-in**
  Includes **dry-run preview mode** and a **metrics system** to ensure the generated structure
  faithfully matches the original design.

- **🧠 Annotation Preservation**
  Extracts `← annotations` and converts them into file-level documentation or README headers.

## 🛠️ AI-Assisted Workflow (Recommended)

1. **Design with AI**
   Ask an LLM:
   > “Design a project architecture for a [project type] using a tree structure.”

2. **Paste**
   Copy the generated structure into `structure.md`.

3. **Generate**
   ```bash
   python -m src.main --readme structure.md --output ./my_new_project
````

4. **Verify**
   Generate metrics to ensure architectural integrity.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/luyaochi/project_structure.git
cd project_structure
pip install -e .
```

### Common Commands

| Description                              | Command                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Preview structure (no files created)** | `python -m src.main --dry-run`                                                     |
| **Generate from a specific file**        | `python -m src.main --readme my_design.md`                                         |
| **Custom output directory**              | `python -m src.main --output ./dist`                                               |
| **Generate verification report**         | `python -m src.generate_metrics --structure structure.md --generated ./my_project` |

## 📊 Architecture Metrics

This tool is more than a generator—it helps prevent **architectural drift** during development:

* **Structural Coverage**
  Measures completeness of directories and files.

* **Hierarchy Accuracy**
  Validates the three-layer structure: Project / Module / Feature.

* **Annotation Retention**
  Ensures design intent is preserved in generated code and documentation.

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

* [ ] **Multi-language Support**
  Built-in templates for Go, Rust, and TypeScript.

* [ ] **AI API Integration**
  Generate architecture suggestions directly from the CLI using LLMs.

* [ ] **GitHub Actions**
  Automatically verify that pull requests do not break the defined project structure.
